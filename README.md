# Dynamic React Storefront for Isaks Bilar

Welcome to the development journey of Isaks Bilar's online storefront, crafted with the robustness of React using Create React App.

## Project Overview

This project's mission is to architect an interactive web store that showcases a catalog of products with seamless navigation and an intuitive shopping experience.

### Product Listing

The heart of the store is a dynamic product listing, where each item is presented with:

- A preview image that captures the essence of the product.
- A concise and informative title.
- A clear display of the price.
- A direct link to a detailed product page.

The design ensures each product is distinctly represented within the list, utilizing clean and modular JSX for structure and style.

### Enhanced Shopping Features

Enhancing the user's shopping experience, each product in the listing includes an "Add to Cart" button, enabling the effortless addition of items to the shopping cart.

### Product Details Page (`pages/Product.js`)

Dive into the details of each product on its dedicated page, which includes:

- A high-resolution product image.
- An engaging title.
- Competitive pricing information.
- A thorough description that highlights key features.
- Availability status, reflecting the current stock levels.

A strategically placed "Add to Cart" button on this page invites users to make a purchase, contributing to a streamlined shopping flow.

### Checkout Experience (`pages/Checkout.js`)

The checkout page is where the excitement builds, listing all the selected items in a user-friendly HTML table format. Here, customers can review:

- Product images for a visual summary of their cart.
- Titles and prices of the chosen items.

The page smartly calculates and displays the total cost of the cart's contents. If the cart is empty, a friendly prompt encourages users to continue shopping, with a button redirecting them to the product list.

### Persistent Shopping Cart Component (`components/Cart.js`)

`Cart.js` is not just a page but a persistent component that accompanies the user throughout their shopping journey, akin to the site's footer and header.

It serves as a mini-cart, listing:

- Product images for recognition.
- Titles for recall.
- Prices for budget tracking.

The component also provides a total cost summary and a convenient button to proceed to checkout, ensuring a smooth transition to purchase completion.
